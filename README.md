# Towards a faster BitCoin Blockchain

## Why?

To securely send and receive BitCoins, it's important to have a full copy of the BitCoin blockchain, BitCoin's public ledger and shared history.  However, the BitCoin blockchain is currently 9GB and growing, which is an impediment to new user adoption due to an itial download that can take days.

In order to improve the BitCoin first time experience (FTUX), we are utilizing Aspera's fasp technology for significantly accelerated blockchain downloads.
